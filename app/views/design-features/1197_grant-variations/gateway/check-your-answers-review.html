Or maybe you don’t see much opportunity for growth or movementin your department. That little voice in your head is saying it’s ready for new challenges, but the thought of leaving your awesome company is really daunting. There’s got to be a better way, right?</p>

                  <p class="govuk-body">As an employer, one of your priorities will be making sure that your team is as productive as possible in helping you achieve your company’s goals. But sometimes an employee may develop a theme of poor timekeeping and absence.</p>
                  <p class="govuk-body">While there may be many justifiable reasons for poor punctuality and excessive sick days, it’s down to you and your employee to resolve any underlying issues to ensure that the business doesn’t take a hit over the lack of productivity that tardiness leads to.</p>
                  <p class="govuk-body">The importance of punctuality is even more imperative in customer-facing businesses, where workers need to be present to serve shoppers in specific timeframes or else the customer experience will suffer.</p>
                  <p class="govuk-body">While the 21st Century has seen something of a shift towards more flexible working hours in many offices, there are still countless environments where it’s impossible to be so lax with timing – and in these cases, the offending employee would need to be approached about their behavior accordingly.</p>
                  <p class="govuk-body">Remember that your employee is human, and as such will have innumerable concerns, distractions and motivations at play under the skin. Perhaps their absenteeism is down to relationship troubles or a long-term family illness? Plenty of companies encourage their workers to leave their problems at the door when they enter the workplace, but sometimes a member of staff will feel overawed and unable to maintain their focus. 228/400 words</p>

                  <p class="govuk-body">Communication is the key to success – humans are social animals designed to thrive in collaborative circumstances. However, some of us are more adept at communicating than others and it’s the failure to share thoughts, ideas and feelings effectively which can lead to uncomfortable situations.</p>
                  <p class="govuk-body">Creating and maintaining teams within a working situation can be key to the success of a business. Bringing a diverse group of people together to work towards a common goal, for example increasing sales outcomes, ensures that different ideas and approaches to reaching the desired outcome can be evaluated and implemented. At least that’s the idea!</p>
                  <p class="govuk-body">The reality can be that often one or two individuals can dominate a group and effectively override everyone else, so it’s beholden on those managing teams to ensure this is not allowed to happen.</p>
                  <p class="govuk-body">Is it a good idea to have people of varying temperaments, abilities and views in one team? Of course it is, because without disagreements there’d be no discussions and without discussions nothing could ever change.</p>

                  <p class="govuk-body">The general aim for practical classes is to enhance students’ understanding of methods of scientific enquiry. This is pursued in a variety of ways where students are given the opportunity to undertake experiments; tackle problem-solving exercises; carry out survey and project work and experience at firsthand how the theory and principles of their discipline are applied. The key learning aims in practical classes (Allison, 1995) are: 
• Consolidate subject knowledge • Introduce disciplinary methods and procedures • Develop technical skills • Develop cognitative skills • Promote teamwork skills • Increase motivation
</p>
                  <p class="govuk-body">Some temp roles are just that, and inevitably have an expiration date, but don’t despair. It’s not uncommon for temporary workers who perform well to be rewarded with a permanent position.</p>
                  <p class="govuk-body">The trick is to prove your worth. Make yourself indispensable to your employer and they’ll naturally want to retain you. If you have the opportunity to gain expertise in an area vital to the business, seize it. Go above and beyond to exceed expectations on a daily basis and show that you’re worth the investment.</p>
                  <p class="govuk-body">The benefits of hands-on learning, or practical learning, is particularly beneficial for STEM subjects as they bring complex concepts to life so they can better retain learned information. According to The Edvocate, “The processes of inquiry, reasoning and collaboration required in STEM learning are similar to any experiential activity; learning activities must be hands-on experiences.</p>
                  <p class="govuk-body">STEM classes also demand rigor and relevance in a curriculum, and the students who take these classes must learn to think critically as they use science, technology, engineering, and mathematics to solve real world problems through direct learning experiences.</p>
                  <p class="govuk-body">Students become more engaged and are more likely to remember the information they have learned due to their experience. Rather than just reading and memorising from a textbook, which can leave many students demotivated and cause them to lose interest, hands-on learning stimulates their senses and enables them to become more connected to their learning.</p>
                  <p class="govuk-body">When they work on real-life projects, students can see the impact of their work, learning important skills along the way. For example, they learn collaborative and critical thinking skills during hands-on learning activities, which are essential for the workplace. It prepares them better for life after graduation, equipping them with job-ready skills and the required academic knowledge. Hands-on learning is, after all, the practical application of academic knowledge. It means students get to visualise, experience and learn by doing. 399/400 words</p>
